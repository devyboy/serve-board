# ServeBoard
Have you ever been to a small bubble tea place or maybe a new coffee shop and had to order from a tablet instead of telling someone what you wanted? I love not interacting with strangers so I think this idea should really catch on. The only issue is, most people don't have the money or expertise to develop an app solely for customers to order their food. This is where ServeBoard comes in. All you need to do is go to the website, make an account, and start creating a menu for people to order from. Then, just open the menu in the customer view on your tablet of choice and you're ready to start taking orders!

## FAQ:
### How will you process payments and stuff?
I dunno yet, I'm getting there.
### Is this really free? What's the catch?
You can only make two menus on the 'free tier' because honestly if you have more than two restaurants you can afford to pay for the enterprise edition which doesn't exist yet but it will.
### How many menus can I make with the enterprise edition?
Good question, I'll get back to you on that one.
